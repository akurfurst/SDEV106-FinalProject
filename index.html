            <p id="aboutMe">Hi, my name is Adam Kurfurst. I am 24 years old and from Bonney Lake Washington. I am 
                currently a student at Green River College in the software development program and expecting my bachelors
                degree to be awarded in the winter of 2027. After graduating high school in 2019 I worked in two sandwich 
                shops where I was able to work up to be a manager. I decided to go back to school in 2024 to pursue a a long-term 
                career. I enjoy gaming and building computers as hobbies, as well as being a car enthusiast. My family includes my parents, 
                three siblings, and a dog, a Weimaraner named Laika. I look forward to becoming a software developer in the future and hope to become a part
                of a team to develop new software ideas and technologies that will help shape our future.
